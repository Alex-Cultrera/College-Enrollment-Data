# College Enrollment Data Sort

Data science project where I created a Java application that helps college professors manage and sort student enrollment data that is stored in a CSV file. 

An array is created from the master list, the data is then parsed into separate arrays for each course, the arrays are sorted by student grade, and then it writes each array to a new file.
